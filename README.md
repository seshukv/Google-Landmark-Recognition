Google Landmark Recognition 2021
A CNN model is trained over a million images using ResNet50v2 to predict the landmark of a test image. 
After performing EDA, the Data is pr-processed on which Sampling, Image augmentation and class weights are used to address the imbalance.
The data for the project can be found from the Google Landmark Recognition 2021 kaggle competition. (URL: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/landmark-recognition-2021)
